# Turk-AdFilter â€“ Turkish Ad & Tracker Blocking List

**Turk-AdFilter** is a community-driven, open-source filter list that blocks ads, trackers, and harmful content providers focused on Turkey. It is compatible with AdGuard, uBlock Origin, Pi-hole, and similar services.

## Quick Start

  ```
- **For DNS-based blockers (e.g., Pi-hole, AdGuard DNS):**
  ```
  GitHub: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omerdduran/turk-adfilter/refs/heads/main/hosts.txt
  Codeberg: https://codeberg.org/omerdduran/turk-adfilter/raw/branch/main/hosts.txt
